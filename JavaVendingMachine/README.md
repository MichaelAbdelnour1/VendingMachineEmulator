<h1>Java Applications - Vending Machine Emulator</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
This repository is about a Vending Machine Emulator that I created in Java which utilizes Object Oriented Methodology (Polymorphism/Inheritance), Generics, File IO to read/write CSV's, Exception Handling, and Collections (HashMap's).
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Java</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 11</b>
- <b>Intelij IDEA</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

Creating a product class, that will utlized by both the Beverage and Snack class through inheritance. 
<br/> Additonally,exception handeling has been implemented to ensure input validation.: <br/>

Creating a Slot class, that utlizes generics to store either a snack or beverage and its quanitity. 
<br/> It also uses exception handeling, to ensure that the quantity entered is a valid input:  <br/>
